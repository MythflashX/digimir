# digimir
Digimir: wanted to control a robot hand with just my gestures, but since I couldn't afford a real one, I made a virtual version using MediaPipe and C++. 

Digimir Project
Overview
Digimir (short for Digital Mirror) is a project that combines gesture recognition and simulation into a cohesive system. The goal is to build a robotic hand that can be controlled by hand gestures. However, due to budget constraints, the project simulates this interaction instead. This is achieved using MediaPipe for gesture recognition and a C++ application for the simulation.

Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
OpenCV
MediaPipe
TensorFlow
C++ Compiler
Raylib
Usage
Simply run the provided batch file to start the project.
