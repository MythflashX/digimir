# Digimir Project

## Overview
**Digimir** (short for Digital Mirror) is a project that combines gesture recognition and simulation into a cohesive system. The goal is to build a robotic hand that can be controlled by hand gestures. However, due to budget constraints, the project simulates this interaction instead. This is achieved using MediaPipe for gesture recognition and a C++ application for the simulation.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- TensorFlow
- C++ Compiler
- Raylib

## Usage
Simply run the provided batch file to start the project.
