- Project Digimir -
Overview
Digimir (short for Digital Mirror) is a project that combines gesture recognition and simulation into a cohesive system.
The goal is to build a robotic hand that can be controlled by hand gestures. However, due to budget constraints, the
project simulates this interaction instead. This is achieved using MediaPipe for gesture recognition and a C++ application for the simulation.


Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
OpenCV
MediaPipe
TensorFlow
C++ Compiler
Raylib
Usage
Simply run the provided batch file to start the project.
